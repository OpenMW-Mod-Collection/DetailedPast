    description:
      Cantemiric Velothi are a group of Chimer and later Dunmer thought to
      be extinct due to epidemic of Knahaten Flu. They lived on the eastern coast of
      Argonia and possibly were worshippers of Aedric Divines, however such description
      is dubious as rejection of Aedric reverence was behind emergence of Chimer as
      a separate race.
