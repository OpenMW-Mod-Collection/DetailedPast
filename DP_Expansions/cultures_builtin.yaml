      strongholds of Rourken clan in Hammerfell. They adopted Dwemer fashion and wear

    description:
      Folrash Ornim - "Sand Orcs" - is a term used to describe two separate,
      but ultimately very similar nomadic cultures which came to existence due to convergent
      evolution. Orsimer of Alik'r desert in Hammerfell and Orsimer of Ne Quin-al desert
      in Elsweyr, though not closely related, exhibit similar traits and culture. Not
      as strong as other Orcs due to adaption for living in harsh conditions of water
      shortage, they took up a life of trade instead that of a fight. They are also
      said to reject traditional Orc worship of Malacath, Mauloch, or Trinimac in favor
      of worshipping Aedra, specifically their interpretation of Wind Goddess Kynareth.

    description:
      "Colovians are inhabitants of Colovia - western part of Cyrodiil province.
      They are respected as Cyrodiil's iron hand: firm, unwavering, and ever-vigilant.
      Disinclined to magic and industry they prefer bloody engagement and plunder. Colovians
      are uncomplicated, self-sufficient, hearty, and extremely loyal to one another.
      They favor simple clothing over extravagant costumes."
